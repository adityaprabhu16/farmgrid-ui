# farmgrid-ui
The web-service UI for FarmGrid - API and User Data Management. FarmGrid is an IoT based solution for farms and lawns that includes cloud backend integration. 

Navigation:
1. index.html - Home page of website. This is where the charts and project description currently are. 

2. script.js - The charts are displayed via Chart.JS, an open source javascript library that allows for customization and design. The JS file within the JS folder holds the code and API calls that render and display data on the chart.

3. info.html - About page of website - has info on the collaborators on this project.

Potential Future Change - Have the description, problem, solution, and demo information on the same page via scrolling menu as a UI-friendly solution, and have the login page be a separate HTML webpage, like: https://miraigroup.jp/en/
